# Week 1 â€” Environmental Monitoring (Preprocessing & EDA)

This repository contains **Week 1** work for the Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control project.  
The focus is on **data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using the Beijing PM2.5 air quality dataset.

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning & handling missing values  
- Temporal, rolling, and meteorological feature engineering  
- Exploratory visualizations of pollutant trends  
- Reusable `scikit-learn` preprocessing pipeline  

**Note:** No ML models are trained in Week 1. The emphasis is on preparing **high-quality, analysis-ready data** for future weeks.
